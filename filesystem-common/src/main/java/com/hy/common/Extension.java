/**
 * Marker for extension interface
 * <p/>
 * Changes on extension configuration file <br/>
 * Use <code>Protocol</code> as an example, its configuration file 'META-INF/dubbo/com.xxx.Protocol' is changes from: <br/>
 * <pre>
 *     com.foo.XxxProtocol
 *     com.foo.YyyProtocol
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * to key-value pair <br/>
 * <pre>
 *     xxx=com.foo.XxxProtocol
 *     yyy=com.foo.YyyProtocol
 * </pre>
 * <br/>
 * The reason for this change is:
 * <p>
 * If there's third party library referenced by static field or by method in extension implementation, its class will
 * fail to initialize if the third party library doesn't exist. In this case, dubbo cannot figure out extension's id
 * therefore cannot be able to map the exception information with the extension, if the previous format is used.
 * <p/>
 * For example:
 * <p>
 * Fails to load Extension("mina"). When user configure to use mina, dubbo will complain the extension cannot be loaded,
 * instead of reporting which extract extension implementation fails and the extract reason.
 * </p>
 *
 * @deprecated because it's too general, switch to use {@link com.alibaba.dubbo.common.extension.SPI}
